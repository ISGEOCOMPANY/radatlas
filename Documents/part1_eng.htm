        Field of natural radioactivity of the Earth exists since the 
  moment of creation of our planet. It is formed both by radionuclides appeared 
  as a result of nuclear transformations during creation of solar system and did 
  not decay for almost five billions years of existence of the Earth and by cosmic 
  radiation. More than 60 natural radionuclides are observed in the biosphere 
  of the Earth. The main radionuclides contributing into the human body burden 
  are those related to uranium-radium and thorium series and potassium-40. Average 
  content of uranium, thorium and potassium in the Earth crust equals 2.5*10-<sup>-4</sup>%, 
  13.0*10<sup>-4</sup>% and 2.5% respectively. Each gram of potassium contains 
  119 micrograms of radioactive potassium-40. Variations in the content of these 
  radionuclides in the surface layer of the Earth mainly depend on the types of 
  geological material, depth of occurrence, soil formation processes and may significantly 
  deviate from average values. Spatial distribution of uranium, characteristics 
  of soils and climate having impact on the processes of gas exchange between 
  soil and atmosphere determine the natural radioactivity of atmosphere. Mainly 
  it is determined by radon-222 and its decay products. Radon-222 is an inert 
  gas with half-life period 3.8 days and it is formed as a result of decay of 
  radium-226. To the south of 55° of northern latitude concentration values of 
  radon-222 in the air varies predominantly between 3.5-7.4 Bq/m<sup>3</sup>.

        Cosmic radiation of galactic and solar origin consists mainly 
  of high-energy protons. Earth's magnetic field and its atmosphere ensure reliable 
  protection of human being and all living things from direct impact of these 
  destructive fluxes. Secondary cosmic radiation in the field of which the inhabitants 
  of the Earth live is formed as a result of interaction of primary cosmic fluxes 
  with Earth’s atmosphere, in particular of respective nuclear reactions resulting 
  in formation of radionuclides, mainly of tritium (hydrogen-3), berilium-7, carbon-14.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        Anthropogenic sources of ionizing radiation appeared together 
  with the natural ones since the beginning of utilization of nuclear energy. 
  Significant global changes in radionuclide content of biosphere started from 
  the middle of XX century due to extensive atmospheric tests of nuclear weapon 
  carried out by nuclear states in 1950-1960s. During powerful nuclear explosions 
  either on the earth or in the atmosphere the main part of radioactive fission 
  products passed to stratosphere, more or less uniformly distributed there, stayed 
  there for months and years and gradually fell on the surface of Earth. Since 
  then short-lived radionuclides decayed and due to fallout of long-lived radionuclides 
  – cesium-137, strontium-90, transuranium elements – global low background radioactive 
  pollution of earth’s surface and aqueous medium have been formed. Maximal levels 
  of soil contamination stipulated by global fallout are inherent to the region 
  of Earth surface located between 40° and 60° of northern latitude. There is 
  a close correlation between levels of global radioactive contamination and amounts 
  of average annual atmospheric precipitation and it explaines somehow a non-uniform 
  distribution of global pollution density.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        Signing by nuclear states (except France and China) of Moscow 
  Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapons Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space, and 
  Under Water put the end to accumulation of global discharges of long-lived radionuclides.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        Underground tests of nuclear weapon and normal operation of 
  nuclear and conventional power plants and nuclear fuel cycle facilities do not 
  have significant impact on natural environment. Generally its additional contribution 
  to anthropogenic background radiation has local character.

        Atlas contains the maps of global pollution of the territory 
  of Ukraine by cesium-137 and strontium-90. While drafting the maps of contamination 
  by cesium-137 and strontium-90 before the accident the data of regional radiological 
  service of the Ministry of Agrarian Policy have been used [<a href="references_eng.htm#ref09">9</a>]. Monitoring of pollution 
  levels have been carried out at experimental grounds established in Ukraine 
  in 1970s. In each of impacted regions there were from one to five of these grounds 
  on the average. Average data regarding cesium-137 and strontium-90 for 1981-1985 
  have been used for preparation of pollution maps. Survey contamination maps

        It should me mentioned that before the accident the territory 
  of Ukraine has been quite uniformly contaminated by cesium-137 and strontium-90 
  of global origin. Insignificant exceeding of contamination levels in mountain 
  area of Crimea and Carpathians can be explained by higher annual precipitation 
  in these regions.

    <h2 align="justify">Contamination caused by Chornobyl catastrophe</h2>
    <p align="justify">
        For almost 40-years history of nuclear power industry there 
  were several significant accidents at nuclear fuel cycle facilities and at nuclear 
  reactors that caused off-site radioactive contamination. The best known of them 
  are: at processing plant in Windscale (Great Britain) and at Kyshtym nuclear 
  facility (USSR) in 1957, at Three Mile Island (USA) in 1979. During Three Mile 
  Island accident 53% of fuel elements have been destroyed and almost 70% of nuclear 
  reaction decay products moved to coolant. Meanwhile due to construction of protection 
  facilities of reactor only insignificant part of radioactive substances has 
  been discharged to environment [<a href="references_eng.htm#ref10">10</a>, <a href="references_eng.htm#ref11">11</a>].
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        Fourth power unit of Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant pertaining 
  to second generation of nuclear power plants with reactors of RBMK type has 
  been commissioned in December of 1983.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        Chronology and causes of the accident at fourth power unit 
  are described in special literature [<a href="references_eng.htm#ref12">12</a>]. Explosion of reactor at 1:24 on the 
  26th of April of 1986 caused radioactive discharge of the reactor core fragments 
  and steam-gas cloud saturated by the fuel debris of different dispersion, aerosol 
  particles and radioactive gases.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        Wide spectrum of forms and content of discharged radioactive 
  products, change of efficient height of discharges, duration of discharges and 
  their non-monotonic nature, change of meteorological conditions during the most 
  intense emission caused formation of complex fields of radioactive contamination 
  by radionuclides and detailed investigations of their structure are still an 
  actual task. Structure of contamination fields of Chornobyl origin is non-uniform, 
  spotted and oblong along the air fluxes lines. Among field structures the following 
  structures are conditionally distinguished: Macrostructure determining the main 
  tracks and spots; mesostructure reflecting field deviations in the framework 
  of distinguished macrostructure peculiarities; local structures (coastline anomalies, 
  waysides, drains etc.). Field macrostructure is determined first of all by meteorological 
  factors – direction and speed of air-mass transport. Status of atmospheric boundary 
  layer, presence of precipitation, landscape factors stipulate mesoscale structure 
  – mosaic of the spots with high and low contamination levels.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        There are three traces on the territory of Ukraine – western, 
  north-eastern and southern – forming the macrostructure of the field. At the 
  time of accident on the 26th of April, 1986 air masses near Chornobyl NPP were 
  under the impact of the outer part of anticyclone. Within this area there were 
  no significant changes of pressure between adjacent air masses. These conditions 
  caused variable directions and low speed of winds. The latter did not exceed 
  2-3 m/sec at the air layer below 600 m. Mainly air-masses were transported to 
  the west. On the 27th of April the pressure decreased and downpours were observed 
  from time to time. Trajectory of the transport of discharge that occurred the 
  day before continued to the west and north-west. Near Chornobyl NPP at 600 m 
  height the direction of wind has been changed to the north with the speed 1-4 
  m/sec. Decreasing of pressure continued on 28th of April. At 100-700 m height 
  the wind speed did not change. Wind direction changed from west to north-east 
  due to low speed. Near-earth pressure decreasing has been continued also on 
  the 29th of April. Wind speed in eastern direction in the near-earth layer increased 
  to 6-16 m/sec. Wind direction on the 30th of April changed from north-east to 
  south-west, and its speed slightly decreased. On the 1st of May wind speed increased 
  to 10 m/sec in southern direction. On the 3rd of May there were still the winds 
  in southern direction with registered storm winds up to 15-22 m/sec. Decreasing 
  of wind speed to 6 m/sec in southern and south-western directions occurred on 
  the 5th of May [<a href="references_eng.htm#ref12">12</a>, <a href="references_eng.htm#ref13">13</a>]. General dynamics of discharge during this time span is 
  presented on the fig. 1.1.

    <p align="justify">
        Differences in the contamination structure of certain territories 
  by different radionuclides are determined by physicochemical properties of radioactive 
  elements. Volatile elements (iodine-131, tellurium-132, cesium-134, -137) mainly 
  passed from reactor as highly dispersed particles and aerosols and its formation 
  had a condensation nature. Significant extent of contamination traces and presence 
  of spots at long distances from reactor is typical for volatile elements. Released 
  refractory elements (zirconium-95, molybdenum-99, cerium-141,-144, plutonium-238,-239,-240,-241, 
  curium-242) passed from reactor in relatively big fuel particles, and its fallout 
  occurred in the exclusion zone, on the territories adjacent to ChNPP.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        Contamination by strontium isotopes has mixed nature and is 
  mainly stipulated by fuel component of the discharge, but for the regions at 
  the distances 150-300 km from ChNPP in the direction of southern trace, contribution 
  of condensation components becames dominant, therefore contamination by strontium-90 
  has significantly spread beyond the exclusion zone. The highest levels of contamination 
  by strontium-90 are observed along western (fuel) and within southern traces. 
  In the latter case the particles in fallouts along the trace had both fuel and 
  condensation origin.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        During the active phase of discharges the nature of processes 
  in the destroyed reactor has been changed and these changes determined the discharge 
  height and intensity. Intensive “explosive” discharge on the 26th of April that 
  has been spread within the near-earth layer formed the narrow “explosive” western 
  trace. Radioactive inert gases (xenon-133 and other), volatile radionuclides 
  (iodine-131, tellurium-132, cesium-134, -137) formed radioactive clouds at significant 
  heights (up to several kilometers) and started its movement in western and north-western 
  directions. Gradually the discharge output decreased to certain extent due to 
  decreasing of temperature in reactor. But since the midday of the 27th of April 
  reactor graphite started to burn more intensively causing new discharges, especially 
  cesium-137. During this time span contamination of the territories both in western 
  and south-western and northern and north-eastern directions has been formed 
  (considering the changes of wind direction at different heights). At that time 
  started the process of filling up of destroyed reactor. On 28-30th of April 
  intensity and height of discharges significantly decreased. This stipulated 
  relatively insignificant contamination levels in eastern and south-eastern directions. 
  From the 2nd to 6th of May reheating of reactor occurred causing the increasing 
  of discharge intensity practically up to the values of the first days of the 
  accident. Formation of southern trace occurred during this time span. Due to 
  increasing of fuel temperature the radionuclide content of discharges has been 
  changed. Content of refractory elements has been increased as compared with 
  more volatile cesium. After the 6th of May radionuclide’s discharges significantly 
  decreased and later on stopped.
