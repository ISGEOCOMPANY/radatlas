<p align="JUSTIFY">Atlas presents the consequences of the accident at Chornobyl nuclear power plant occurred on April 26, 1986. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Apart from radioactive contamination of the territory of Ukraine, a lot of attention is paid to principal problems of suffered people and society after the accident.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The Atlas consists of 4 sections:</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><a href="part1_eng.htm"><b>First section</b></a> contains the maps of the field of contamination by cesium-137, strontium-90, sum of plutonium isotopes and predictive map of contamination by americium-241. For the territory of Ukraine in general these maps are presented on scale 1:2 500 000 and for the most contaminated territory (exclusion zone) on scale 1:300,000. Maps of contamination of Ukraine by cesium-137 and strontium-90 before the accident are presented for comparison (scale 1:12 000 000). 
Additionally this section contains scheme-map of radioactive waste repositories in the exclusion zone and maps of contamination by cesium-137 of the cities of Korosten and Slavutych and adjacent territories.  Latter maps have been plotted using the results of aerial gamma survey on scale 1:25 000, however in the Atlas these maps are presented on scale 1:100 000. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><a href="part2_eng.htm"><b>Second section</b></a> of the Atlas comprises the maps presenting the impact of radioactive contamination on human being and medical consequences of the accident. The most important maps of the section – total effective doses of internal and external irradiation for 20 and 70 years after the accident (scale 1:2 500 000) and exposure doses of thyroid gland for seven age categories of population (scale 1:5 000 000). These maps have been prepared using the data of the Research Centre for Radiation Medicine of Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine and Radiation Protection Institute ATS Ukraine. The map of milk contamination by cesium-137 (average annual values for the most contaminated regions, 1991-2006) and other maps are included in the section.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><a href="part3_eng.htm"><b>Third section contains</b></a>  the maps of social and economic consequences of Chornobyl catastrophe - for zones of radioactive contamination according to the legislation in force, number and composition of population having the status of affected as a result of Chornobyl catastrophe, improving children's health of this category, etc. Maps reflecting migration of population from contaminated territories and housing construction in the framework of the Program on liquidation of Chornobyl catastrophe consequences are also included in this section. Maps of this section are presented on scales 1:2 500 000 and 1:5 000 000.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><a href="part4_eng.htm"><b>The fourth section </b></a> includes reference materials and maps. In particular, map of stations for radiometric monitoring network of the State Hydrometeorological Service of Ukraine, maps of soils, maps of forest zoning by the density of radioactive contamination by cesium-137 are presented.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">All Atlas’s sections contain explanatory texts explaining peculiarities of phenomena presented on the maps and its interpretation.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Atlas is oriented on the employees of executive authorities of all levels, scientists and wide circle of readers.</p>
