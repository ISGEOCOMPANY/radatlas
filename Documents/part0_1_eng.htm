<p align="justify">More than 25 years elapsed after the date of the accident at Chornobyl NPP on April 26, 1986. Since then significant changes took place in the society, social-political and economical way of life in Ukraine. However consequences of this accident are still topical and require a consolidated participation of whole country in resolution of the problems caused by these consequences.</p>
<p align="justify">Millions of Ukrainian citizens have been affected as a result the accident at Chornobyl NPP – the largest technogeneous catastrophe in nuclear power industry. Impact of the accident on public health, its social and economic consequences determine living conditions in the contaminated territories today and will continue to do so for dozens of coming years. </p>
<p align="justify">Beginning from the first days of liquidation of the accident considerable efforts have been focused on studying the levels of radioactive contamination of environment. Radiation monitoring system has been established which includes hundreds of laboratories and radiological monitoring posts. Until now this infrastructure executes regular assessment of actual radiation status of contaminated territories and controls contamination of products produced here. Hundreds of thousands of measurements were exercised to determine radionuclides’ content in water, atmospheric aerosols, fallouts and sediments, soil, agricultural and forestry products. Whole territory of Ukraine has been surveyed with different levels of details using aerial gamma-spectrometric methods. Annual dosimetric passportization is executed in the settlements enrolled in the zones of enhanced radioecological monitoring and guaranteed voluntary relocation and in the villages of compulsory relocation zone where local people still live. Its results are the basis for planning and execution of counter-radiation measures and for preparation of proposals regarding reviewing the boundaries of radioactive contamination zones.</p>
<p align="justify">Maps of radioactive contamination of the territory of Ukraine have been mapped on the basis of results of monitoring surveys.  These maps have been published in a number of publications, in particular - special atlases of contamination of Europe by cesium [<a href="references_eng.htm#ref01">1</a>], radioactive contamination of the European part of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine [<a href="references_eng.htm#ref02">2</a>], atlas of Chornobyl exclusion zone [<a href="references_eng.htm#ref03">3</a>]. Main attention in the publications is paid to contamination of the territory by cesium-137 which is a basic dose-forming radionuclide during the late phase of Chornobyl accident. Maps of contamination of the territory by other radionuclides having a great radiological importance - strontium-90, plutonium isotopes, americium-241 - for the territory of Ukraine are just illustrative.</p>
<p align="justify">Since the publication of mentioned editions significant activities have been executed aimed at analysis and sorting of radiological monitoring data.  Part of the territory has been surveyed additionally mainly by aerial gamma-spectrometric survey and to a lesser degree by surface sample-taking. New results of studies allowed to prepare more precise maps of contamination of Ukraine by cesium-137 and and based on them to develop the maps of contamination by strontium-90, plutonium isotopes, and americium-241. Therefore it became necessary to publish new maps of contamination of Ukraine by cesium-137 and maps of contamination by other radionuclides which were previously printed only as small-scale charts.</p>
<p align="justify">However separate maps of radioactive contamination do not provide complete picture of its impact on the health of population, creation of comprehensive edition became necessary.</p>
<p align="justify">Ionizing radiation is a major determinative factor in the scope of radiation accident. Irradiation dose received by human being as a result of Chornobyl catastrophe and that will be received in future on condition of living on the contaminated territory is an integral index reflecting the impact of all radionuclides. It is also important that during last ten years (and in coming years as well) the major contribution in total radiation dose has been made by internal irradiation due to intake of food products produced on the territory of radioactive contamination zones, mainly in northern regions of Ukrainian Polissya. Map of milk contamination mapped by the results of long-term observations on contaminated territories is included in the Atlas.</p>
<p align="justify">Complex of problems caused by Chornobyl catastrophe requires considerable intellectual, administrative, social and public and economic efforts aimed at its resolution. Accident consequences liquidation in the framework of national-wide program of overcoming the consequences of Chornobyl catastrophe have been financed for some time at the account of national Chornobyl fund formed from a special charge (tax). Now it is financed mainly from general fund of State budget of Ukraine.</p>
<p align="justify">Third section of the Atlas presents the problems of social and economic consequences of the catastrophe. It contains inter alia two principally important maps – the map of the radioactive contamination zones according to Ukrainian legislation in force and the map of one of the possible composition of contamination zones according to dosimetric passportization executed during the last years.</p>
<p align="justify">Special reference section has been included in the Atlas due to complexity and multi-dimensional nature of the problems related to Chornobyl catastrophe consequences. This section contains the maps of soils of Ukraine since different types of soils determine the various radionuclides transition coefficients from soil to vegetable food that later on get in the human body via food chains. Presence of soils with high transition coefficient is determinative in forming of internal irradiation dose of inhabitants of Ukrainian Polissya. This section contains the maps of radiation monitoring network and zoning of forests by the density of radioactive contamination by cesium-137. Methods used for development of basic maps of the Atlas are briefly described.</p>
